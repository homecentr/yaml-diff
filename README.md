# @homecentr/yaml-diff library

The library is published to npmjs and can be installed using the command below:

yarn add @homecentr/yaml-diff
```

Please note that the library is not a generic yaml diff, it only detects specific differences in yaml files structure which is used to compare variables for non-prod and prod environments in other repositories.
